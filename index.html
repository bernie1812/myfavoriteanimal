	<h1>The Orangutan</h1>

	<p>The Malay word orangutan means "person of the forest." These long-haired, orangish primates, found only in Sumatra and Borneo, are highly intelligent and are close relatives of humans.</p>

	<p id="description">Orangutans have an enormous arm span. A male may stretch his arms some 7 feet (2 meters) from fingertip to fingertipâ€”a reach considerably longer than his standing height of about 5 feet (1.5 meters). When orangutans do stand, their hands nearly touch the ground.</p>
